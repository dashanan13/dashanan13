My name is Mohit and I love technology and talking to people, not just about technology!
I have had many roles in my decade long career ranging from support engineer to data engineer and cloud architect.

I have been delivering cloud projects both infrastructure and data for over half a decade now with a few cents of devops expertise.
My latest endevor is towards mobile blockchain revolution and how can they make IOT more, well, reliable and accessible. 

Github keeps a lot of my tech absurdity and i love it for that, its an amazing platform to learn and show.
